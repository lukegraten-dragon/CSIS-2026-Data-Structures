// Functions and Pointers

#include <iostream>

using namespace std ;

/*
A pointer variable can be passed as a parameter to a function either by value or by
reference. To declare a pointer as a value parameter in a function heading, you use
the same mechanism as you use to declare a variable. To make a formal parameter be
a reference parameter, you use & when you declare the formal parameter in the function
heading. Therefore, to declare a formal parameter as a reference pointer parameter,
between the data type name and the identifier name, you must include * to make
the identifier a pointer and & to make it a reference parameter. 

The obvious question is: In what order should & and * appear between the data type 
name and the identifier to declare a pointer as a reference parameter? 

In C++, to make a pointer a reference parameter in a function heading, * appears 
before the & between the data type name and the identifier. 

The following example illustrates this concept:
*/
void pointerParameters(int* &p, double *q) ;
/*
In the function pointerParameters, both p and q are pointers. The parameter p is a
reference parameter; the parameter q is a value parameter. Furthermore, the function
pointerParameters can change the value of *q, but not the value of q. However, the
function pointerParameters can change the value of both p and *p.
